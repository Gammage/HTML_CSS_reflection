# HTML_CSS_reflection

HTML CSS Reflection project, using the information and skills obtained so far with various learning resources to imitate netmatters website.

I used CSS Peeper to gather information on styling for the website, as well as the colours used and assets.
I used font awesome for the icons, they are not exact to netmatters but were free.
With IE a prompt appears to enable them, they are blocked by default however.

To my ability I have tested this project on chrome, firefox and internet explorer.
