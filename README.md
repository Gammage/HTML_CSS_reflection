# HTML_CSS_reflection

HTML CSS Reflection project, using the information and skills obtained so far with various learning resources to imitate netmatters website.

I used CSS Peeper to gather information on styling for the website, as well as the colours used and assets.

To my ability I have tested this project on chrome, firefox and internet explorer.
